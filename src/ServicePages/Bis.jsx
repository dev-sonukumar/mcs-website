            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            BIS Registration is the process of obtaining a license from the
            Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for products that comply with
            applicable Indian Standards. BIS, the National Standards Body of
            India, was established under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act,
            2016, and operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food &
            Public Distribution, Government of India.
          </p>
          <p>
            BIS is responsible for various activities, including standards
            formulation, product certification, testing, training, hallmarking,
            laboratory services, and calibration schemes. BIS registration
            serves as third-party assurance of a product’s quality, safety, and
            reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bureau grants licenses to manufacturers whose products fall
            under mandatory or voluntary certification schemes. Once certified,
            manufacturers can display the BIS Standard Mark on their products.
            While BIS certification is generally voluntary, the Indian
            government mandates it for specific products to safeguard public
            health, the environment, national security, and the welfare of
            people, animals, and plants. Additionally, it aims to prevent unfair
            trade practices.

          <h3>BIS Registration for Electronics & IT Products</h3>
          <p>
            BIS Registration is particularly crucial for electronic and IT
            products, as compliance with quality control standards is mandatory.
            This page provides a comprehensive guide to BIS Registration under
            the Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS). To fully grasp the
            necessity of BIS certification, we will explore its nature,
            structure, and history. Let's delve into the BIS Registration
            process for Electronics and IT Products.

            Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS)
          </h2>
          <p>
            To protect consumers from counterfeit and substandard electronic
            products, the Department of Electronics and Information Technology
            (DeitY) and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced the
            Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS) in 2012. This scheme mandates
            that electronic and IT products must obtain BIS certification before
            being launched in the market. The Ministry has also issued
            Compulsory Registration Orders, stating that no one shall
            manufacture, store, sell, import, or distribute products that do not
            meet Indian standards or lack the Standard Mark with a unique
            registration number. Under the CRS, BIS grants a registration
            certificate to manufacturers, allowing them to display the Standard
            Mark on their electronic and IT products. This certification is
            based on a self-declaration of conformity with Indian Standards. A
            BIS license assures consumers that the product meets quality and
            safety standards as required by law. The licensing process follows
            the conformity assessment scheme under Scheme II of Schedule II of
            the BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018.

          <p>
            The Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS) applies to a wide range of
            electronic and IT products that must comply with Indian Standards
            before being sold in the market. The Bureau of Indian Standards
            (BIS) has made certification mandatory for these products to ensure
